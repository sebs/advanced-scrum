# Advanced Scrum

This workshop aims at teams who started without formal training, maybe by reading a book, into using scrum. 
It tries to re-inforce the absolute basics, try a management buy in to the values and make everyone aware of the new roles and their responsibilities. 

The workshop is a 2 day experience based on the mechanics of "Training from back of the room"
